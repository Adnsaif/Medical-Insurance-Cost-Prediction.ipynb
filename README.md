n: int = ..., Return the last `n` rows. This function returns last `n` rows from the object based on position. It is useful for quickly verifying data, for example, after sorting or appending rows. For negative values of `n`, this function returns all rows except the first `|n|` rows, equivalent to `df[|n|:]`. If n is larger than the number of rows, this function returns all rows. Parameters ---------- n : int, default 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of rows to select. Returns ------- type of caller &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last `n` rows of the caller object. See Also -------- DataFrame.head : The first `n` rows of the caller object. Examples -------- ``` >>> df = pd.DataFrame({'animal': ['alligator', 'bee', 'falcon', 'lion', ... 'monkey', 'parrot', 'shark', 'whale', 'zebra']}) >>> df animal 0 alligator 1 bee 2 falcon 3 lion 4 monkey 5 parrot 6 shark 7 whale 8 zebra ``` Viewing the last 5 lines ``` >>> df.tail() animal 4 monkey 5 parrot 6 shark 7 whale 8 zebra ``` Viewing the last `n` lines (three in this case) ``` >>> df.tail(3) animal 6 shark 7 whale 8 zebra ``` For negative values of `n` ``` >>> df.tail(-3) animal 3 lion 4 monkey 5 parrot 6 shark 7 whale 8 zebra ```, hint
